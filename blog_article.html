            The very first step in this checklist is to decide if you want a pair of gaming headphones or a pair of
            gaming headsets.
          </p>
          <p>So what is the difference between gaming headphones and gaming headsets?</p>
          <p>
            Gaming Headphones = Regular Headphones + Separate Mic Gaming headphones are regular headphones that are used
            traditionally for music enjoyment. However, they possess qualities that are awesome for gaming needs too.
            Audiophilic characteristics such as great micro-detail retrieval, accurate sound stage and immersive sound
            experience make them feasible to double up as a pair of gaming headphones.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, most audiophile headphones do not come with a mic nor do they have any mic attachment slots. You
            will need to get an external mic like the Blue Yeti X for communication support.
          </p>

            A professional gamer who uses a gaming headphones setup is Ninja, famous for streaming PUBG and Fortnight.
            He uses the Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro with Audio Technica AT2035 Cardioid Condenser Microphone while streaming
            his games.
          </p>
          <p>There are several benefits and drawbacks to using a gaming headphones setup for gaming.</p>
          <p>
            Benefits of Gaming Headphones Higher upsides for audio and mic quality As you have a wider product selection
            for both the headphones and mic itself, you are able to assemble your gaming setup with the latest mic and
            headphones. There is potential for better overall audio and microphone quality.
